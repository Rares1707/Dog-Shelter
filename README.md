# Dog Shelter Application

## Overview
This is the final iteration of the project developed for the Object-Oriented Programming module at Babes-Bolyai University during my undergraduate degree. It is an application which which allows users to adopt dogs from a dog shelter. Additionally, it includes administrative functionalities, allowing the administrator to manage the dog repository.

## Features
- built using layered architecture
- follows the OOP paradigm
- features a graphical bar chart, an iterator through the repository and tests for some of the functionalities
- displays data in CSV or HTML format
- has 2 modes: the administrator mode and the user mode
- allows the administrator to  insert, delete and modify data directly
- allows the user to filter and iterate throught the list of dogs, see their pictures and view a bar chart. The user can also adopt dogs, which will become part of his adoption list 
- any modifications to the repository data made during the execution of the application will persist
- validates input data

## Technologies used
- C++ 
- Qt for the GUI

## Screenshots
**Note: The visual appeal of the GUI was not a primary consideration.**
